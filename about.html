                 Founded in 2005, the Pura Vida Foundation (meaning Pure Life in Spanish) is a Registered Charity in Canada, concentrating on some of the most desperate areas of Latin America. The Foundationâ€™s mission is to improve the lives of children and youth in Latin America through fostering healthy and supportable living.

                 The goal is to provide marginalized and exploited young girls in Peru with basic necessities such as a dependable supply of food, safe housing, and necessary resources to enhance their quality of life. We hope that our initiatives will help to relieve suffering and help strengthen the lives of many desperate children and communities. Together we can enhance living conditions and help to eradicate such devastating poverty.

                 The foundation is working towards sexually exploited young girls of Cusco, Peru and surrounding areas. The new Pura Vida shelter will start as a safe place for young girls getting off the streets. The shelter will supply these young girls with food, safe housing, rehabilitation and activities such as photography, art, music and most importantly LOVE!!!  If a girl only needs a bed for the night, that will be an option, but the goal will be to encourage them to stay in the shelter and work with the available staff to help them create a brighter future for themselves.  There are plans to have several directors assist in running the shelter, as well as a psychologist on site to help transition the girls from the streets.  The hope is that the girls will be able to get back into the school system, live in the shelter and then once finished school, be able to find employment.
