                    The weight training sessions will be held at Westcore Training Center located at 707 Johnson street. Link to the site is <a href="http://www.westcoretraining.com/">here.</a> These will have emphasis on basic fundamental weight lifting and power lifting movements like the squat, deadlife, clean, and bench press. Safety is our number one priority. However, heavy weights and intensity are a neccessity for success. With our coaching and form and technique analysis we ensure that all lifts are performed safely to minimize risk of injury. When it's time to lift we will bring the intensity! We encourage you to get fired up too! Click

                 These sessions will be held outdoors in large open spaces like soccer fields, parks, beaches, and hills. This is part of the fun and creative training component in the program. We will be utilizing open space to work on vertical and later explosiveness, foot speed and agility, lower body strength and power, endurance and conditiong, and full body awareness and strength. Workouts will include things like hill sprints, sand agility training, plyometrics, and sled pushes to name a few. Outdoor training may feel a little different for some but it is extremly rewarding. There is so much that is difficult to do in the gym especially when it comes to realistic sports based training. We have beautiful weather in Victoria, lets get out there, enjoy it, and get in shape!

                Callisthenics and Bodyweight Routines
                </div>
                <div class="_font_style">
                This is a component of fitness that is often overlooked or underestimated. It is crucial to
                developing core strength, functionability, muscle awareness, and balance. Learning to support and control your own bodyweight in all positions is a must for any level of fitness. We use a combination of the gym, large open spaces, and local playgrounds for our callisthenics and bodyweight routines. Personally, I have worked out on playgrounds for years and seen phenomenal results. You will be amazed at how much we can do with a simple set of monkey bars and other apparatuses. All the kids are indoors these days anyways so the playgrounds are free to be used! Come get ripped abs in the sun!
                All of our program s are preceeding with proper active warm up and stretching.
